# DBSCAN
DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a data clustering algorithm proposed by Martin Ester, Hans-Peter Kriegel, Jörg Sander and Xiaowei Xu in 1996. The algorithm had implemented with pseudocode described in [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN), but it is not optimised.
  
# Example  
You can test this DBSCAN algorithm with example code(main.cpp) & sample data(test_data_*.dat).
  
# Results
Clustering performance was tesed via clustering-benchmark dataset and real-world dataset.  
  
## benchmark dataset  
Artificial dataset was used to test clustering algorithm which can be obtained [here](https://github.com/deric/clustering-benchmark). Following parameters were used:  
1. Minimum number of points: 4
2. Epsilon: 0.5
